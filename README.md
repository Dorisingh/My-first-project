# My first Project
 I am new to Open Source. I am also just starting with software development.

It is my second time on Github, I am still learning.

Currently, I am learning Python and looking for good resources on Python.

Currently, I work as a hardware engineer in a company.

I want to learn python and build softwares and want help companies with their softwares remotely.
